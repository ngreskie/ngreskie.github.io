    ### Project Overview
    This project involved designing a set of injection molds for use with community plastic injection machines. The challenge was to ensure the vision for the final product was achievable with manufacturing constraints while minimizing material waste and post-processing.
    
    ### Design Process
    Started with analysis of the injection machine including shot size and nozzle geometry. Used SolidWorks for 3D modeling and simulation.
    
    ### Key Achievements
    - Successful products produced with first mold iteration.
    
    ### SolidWorks Plastic Injection Simulation
    Relevant Results:
    - Filling Time: 7.68 seconds
    - Injection Pressure Required: 1.00 MPa (145.33 psi)
    Simulation Assumptions:
    - Melt Temperature: 210째C (410째F)
    - Mold Wall Temperature: 40째C (104째F)
