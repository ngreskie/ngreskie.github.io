    ### Project Overview
    This project involved designing a set of injection molds for use with community plastic injection machines. The challenge was to ensure the vision for the final product was achievable with manufacturing constraints.
    
    ### Design Process
    Started with analysis of the injection machine including shot size and nozzle geometry. Used SolidWorks for 3D modeling and simulation. After designing the mold, plastic injection simulations were run to verify feasibility of manufacturing and tune initial production settings. The simulation calculated a mold filling time of 7.68 seconds with an injection pressure of 1.00 MPa (145.33 psi), assuming a melt temperature of 210 °C and a mold wall temperature of 40 °C. These results were used as a starting point for production.
    
    ### Key Achievements
    - Successful products produced with first mold iteration.
    - Design for sheet metal mold reduced upfront costs.

    ### Project Overview
    Developed a comprehensive Python-based tool to automate CNC program analysis and collect key data points for raw material consumption calculations, tool and setup sheet generation, and machine code snippet creation. The tool searches machine code folders, parses G-code files, and extracts data.
    
    ### Challenge
    Inaccurate department material consumption calculations negatively affected budget and material requests/ordering.
    
    ### Solution
    - Previous efforts to update material consumption figures followed a procedure unfit for automation. Spent time learning the tools available (final part drawings vs. machine code)
    - Developed a python program to find part O.A.L. by dynamically targeting user defined department PROG-ID folders, 1000-level files, and machine code variables (O.A.L)
    - Received feedback and revised product to allow for even greater extraction flexibility. User can easily search for any machine code variable and small edits code will allow for full control over the extraction system.
    - Built a graphical user interface using python libraries and packaged as an app to allow for machine code extraction without having python knowledge or access to VSCode.
