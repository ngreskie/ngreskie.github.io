# About Me

Hi, I'm Noah â€” a mechanical engineering student passionate about mechanical design, manufacturing, and process optimization.  
I enjoy taking projects from concept through to prototyping and manufacturing, with an emphasis on efficiency and practical problem-solving.

In my free time, I explore CAD design, automation tools, and sustainable engineering solutions.
