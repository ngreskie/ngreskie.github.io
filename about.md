# About Me

Hi, I'm Noah — a mechanical engineering student passionate about product design, additive manufacturing, and process optimization. I enjoy taking projects from concept through to manufacturing.

Outside of mechanical engineering, I’m interested in machine learning, cybersecurity, and data security. I’m also passionate about the right to repair movement, Linux, and open source projects. I enjoy working on maker projects and repairing devices. I love learning and exploring new ideas.
